# Waves_Tools

<i> Module contains tools for analyze ocean wave timeseries. Unsurpervised clustering algorithms have been also implemented for classify the ocean wave, according to the caracteristics Hs (Wave amplitude [m]), Tp (Wave period [s]) and Direction (direction of the train wave [Â°]).</i>

# How it works

<blockquote> class <b>Wave_Tools</b>(data, seasons_split=False,clustering=None, n_k=None, p_err = None) </blockquote>
## Parameters
<blockquote> data :: (DataFrame)</blockquote> 
 <i> DataFrame contains two or Three columns Hs Tp  and Direction, need to be analysed
